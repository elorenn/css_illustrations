<!-- This is my first time ever drawing with CSS. I'm pretty happy with how this little bee came out. I tried to limit myself to a single div, but ended up having to use three. Learning how to use border-radius, background image patterns, and box-shadows in creative ways. Next time I'll be better. Thanks for looking!  -->
